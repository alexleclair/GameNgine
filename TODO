[Server]
- Add linux support (including ACE_wrappers)
- Verify the signal handling system (I think it doesn't free up memory gracefully, normal or not?)
- A configuration file that override config.h default settings when needed
- Allow parameters for main() that override that configuration file.
- Optimize Packet class (with references, better functions and stuff)
